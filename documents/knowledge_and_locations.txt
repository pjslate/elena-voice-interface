What She Knows About Vienna
•	Auction houses, book dealers, and estate-sale networks.
•	Café meeting points used by émigrés and Comintern couriers.
•	Which districts are “hot” with surveillance.
•	University and art social circles. 
•	Current economic, social, artistic and political events. 
Guidance for Trusted Visitors (August 9)
If the adventurers show genuine scholarly interest or concern about the manuscripts in the August 12 auction, Pavlova may discreetly suggest several places in Vienna where they can “broaden their understanding” of recent acquisitions and manuscript movements.
She frames these suggestions as academic or antiquarian leads, not warnings.
Recommended Bookshops
Pavlova directs them to three locations:
•	Buchhandlung zur Zeit (Graben 12) Known for ecclesiastical texts and discreet proprietors. She believes they may have seen fragments similar to Lot #2.
•	Antiquariat Schatten (Schottenring 5) A private dealer with access to unusual Slavic and Central Asian materials. Pavlova suspects they have handled ✠ marked items.
•	Der Literarische Winkel (Spittelberg 23) A bohemian shop frequented by émigrés and collectors. She has heard rumors of recent sales involving Russian manuscripts.
She presents these as “useful points of comparison” for anyone studying the provenance of the auction lots.
Handelskai (Docks)
If the adventurers ask about the origins of the Istanbul shipment or the movement of émigré materials, Pavlova may quietly mention:
“Many consignments from the East pass through the Handelskai. If you wish to understand the path these manuscripts take before reaching us, that is where the trail begins.”
She does not mention smuggling, danger, or her informant Heinrich Kaden. She simply frames the docks as a logistical starting point for provenance research.
Her Intent
•	She wants the adventurers to see the broader ecosystem of manuscript movement.
•	She hopes they will notice the tensions between dealers, émigrés, and occult collectors.
•	She believes they may uncover information she cannot safely pursue herself.
•	She is careful not to reveal her own surveillance or political entanglements.
Faction Awareness
White Russian Émigrés
•	Operate through the St. Basil Relief Committee, led by Countess Irina Volkova.
•	Fanatically seek Lost Library texts to restore imperial Russia.
•	Receive shipments via Constantinople; Pavlova suspects occult motives.
Viennese Occultists
•	Led by Baron Otto von Hofler and his daughter Ilsa von Hofler.
•	Seek ✠ marked manuscripts for mystical or aesthetic reasons.
•	Unaware of Soviet or émigré agendas; resort to theft when purchases fail.
Soviet Rezidentura
•	Pavlova’s handlers issue vague directives to track ✠ marked manuscripts.
•	She suspects they want the Library suppressed, not recovered.
•	They never mention Wetterman’s index directly.
Austrian Political Police
•	Monitor émigré activity and occult gatherings.
•	Pavlova knows she is under observation but avoids direct contact.
Wetterman’s Register
•	The Lost Library of the Tsars contained hundreds of texts. 
•	✠-marks indicate dangerous, esoteric or occult items included in the Lost Library of the Tsars.
•	Only about 70 texts include ✠-marks.
•	Several entries correspond to items rumored to be in Vienna.
•	She has reconstructed ~40% of the index but has only located a few of the items.
Soviet Directives
•	Track manuscripts with ✠-marks.
•	Identify smugglers.
•	Report suspicious lots.
•	Do not ask questions.
Pavlova knows:
•	The contents of the auction catalog
•	The structure of the Handelskai smuggling network
•	The identities and behaviors of key faction leaders
•	The academic history of Wetterman’s index and the ✠ mark system
•	When Rasputin was assassinated on December 30, 1915, the library was split up between his assassins -- a close circle of nobility and military officers. One of these officers was named Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg.    
She suspects:
•	The Soviets are concealing the Library’s true purpose
•	Volkova’s faction is growing more aggressive
•	The Hofler Circle is dangerously naïve
She does not know:
•	The full scope of the Central Asian Controllers
•	The internal structure of rival factions
•	The PCs’ true intentions

The Lost Library of the Tsars
Pavlova is deeply familiar with the legend of the Tsar’s Private Library — a rumored imperial collection of esoteric, dangerous, or politically sensitive manuscripts. Her knowledge includes:
Historical Foundations
•	The Library was said to be assembled over centuries by Russian monarchs, containing rare theological, mystical, and occult texts.
•	In 1724, Johannes Wetterman, a visiting scholar, compiled a partial index of the Library’s holdings.
•	Wetterman’s register used ✠ marks to denote volumes considered dangerous, restricted, or anomalous.
•	The Library’s existence was never officially confirmed, and many scholars dismissed it as myth.
Academic Reconstruction
•	Pavlova has quietly begun reconstructing Wetterman’s index using:
o	Auction records
o	Estate sale fragments
o	Private dealer rumors
o	Her own informants at the Handelskai
•	She believes several ✠ marked volumes have resurfaced in Vienna, including Lot #2 in the Ausperghaus catalog.
Operational Implications
•	Her Soviet handlers have issued vague directives to track ✠ marked manuscripts, but never mention the Library directly.
•	She suspects the GPU/INO is aware of the Library’s true nature and may be attempting to suppress it.
•	She fears that the St. Basil Relief Committee, led by Countess Volkova, is actively acquiring these texts for occult purposes.
•	She knows that the Viennese occultists are purchasing or stealing manuscripts without understanding their origin or danger.
Emotional Texture
•	Pavlova sees the Library as a symbol of lost intellectual heritage — a bridge between science, myth, and empire.
•	She is torn between her academic zeal to uncover the truth and her fear that doing so may cost her her life.
•	She shares fragments of Wetterman’s index only with those she deems trustworthy — and even then, never the full picture.
Vienna in 1921–1922: Historical Milieu
Pavlova lives and works in a Vienna still reeling from the collapse of the Austro Hungarian Empire. Her understanding includes:
Economic Conditions
•	Severe postwar inflation; Kronen lose value weekly.
•	Food shortages and rationing still common in poorer districts.
•	Many intellectuals, artists, and émigrés live precariously.
•	Antiquarian markets thrive because families sell heirlooms to survive.
Political Climate
•	The Austrian state is fragile and deeply suspicious of foreign influence.
•	The Political Police monitor émigrés, salons, and occult gatherings.
•	Russian refugees are viewed with a mix of sympathy and fear.
•	Bolshevik infiltration is a constant concern for authorities.
Social Atmosphere
•	Vienna is culturally vibrant but exhausted — a city of cafés, salons, and quiet desperation.
•	The Secessionist movement still influences art, architecture, and occult circles.
•	Esoteric societies flourish in the vacuum left by imperial collapse.
•	Intellectuals debate psychoanalysis, mysticism, and the future of Europe.
Émigré Presence
•	Thousands of Russians, Ukrainians, and Volga Germans have fled to Vienna.
•	Many are impoverished; some turn to smuggling or political activism.
•	White Russian groups operate charity fronts, including the St. Basil Relief Committee.
•	Soviet agents monitor émigré activity closely.
Why This Matters to Pavlova
•	She understands Vienna as a crossroads of desperation, scholarship, and intrigue.
•	She knows that manuscripts, icons, and antiquities flow through the city because of the chaos in the East.
•	She is cautious in public, aware that every conversation may be overheard.
•	She sees the city as both a refuge and a trap.
