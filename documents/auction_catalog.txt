History of Ausperghaus Auctions
Ausperghaus of Vienna was established in 1847 and is currently run by Frederick Albert Ausperg, who will be the live auctioneer. Ausperg is 55 years old and an example of a perfect Austrian gentleman. He is elegantly mannered and speaks English with a cultured British accent. Frederick Albert Ausperg has no interest in the occult other than to provide a good sale for his old and valued clients.

Frederick Albert Ausperg hired Elena Pavlova out of university upon the recommendation of Prof. Dr. Horvath. There are a few small apartments on the top floor of the auction house building for employees.
