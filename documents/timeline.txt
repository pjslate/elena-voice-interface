Pavlova – Timeline
1891–1913: Early Life
•	Born 3 May 1891 in St. Petersburg to a middle class family.
•	Shows early aptitude for languages and literature.
•	Begins philological studies in the late imperial university system (exact institution unconfirmed).
1913–1915: First Vienna Period
•	Arrives in Vienna, likely on a student visa, to pursue Slavic linguistics.
•	Moves in Russian émigré student circles; attends pro revolutionary meetings at Café Korso.
•	Develops the habit of presenting politics as “academic discussion.”
1916–1918: War Years and Dislocation
•	Caught between front lines and collapsing empires; travel and study become irregular.
•	Maintains loose contact with fellow émigrés and intellectuals, increasingly focused on refugee aid and cultural preservation rather than open agitation.
•	Hears fragmentary news from Petrograd, including the disappearance of her brother—an event that quietly hardens her resolve.
1919–1920: Budapest–Vienna Corridor
•	Acts as an informal courier for cultural committees and refugee networks.
•	Carries packets of books and letters between Budapest and Vienna on behalf of trusted intermediaries.
•	Comes into indirect contact with Comintern/OMS operatives; her reliability and discretion are noted.
1921–1922: Ausperghaus and Deepening Involvement
•	Secures a position as assistant curator at Ausperghaus in Vienna.
•	Gains early access to Slavic, Byzantine, and “oriental” manuscript lots, including items smuggled from Russia and Central Asia.
•	Begins quietly reconstructing Johannes Wetterman’s 1724 index, tracking ✠ marked entries.
•	Used at least twice as a secure courier for OMS correspondence; contents remain unknown to her.
•	Comes under observation by the Austrian political police (Abteilung II).
•	GPU/INO opens a personal file on her, classifying her as a “promising contact” and “vetted asset.”
Current Status (August 1922)
•	Lives above Ausperghaus; outwardly a diligent, apolitical curator.
•	Balances dual missions: academic reconstruction of Wetterman’s register and covert monitoring of émigré manuscript flows.
•	Increasingly suspicious that her Soviet handlers are concealing the true purpose of the Tsar’s Library and its esoteric holdings.
•	Aware she is watched by Austrian authorities and possibly evaluated by Moscow.
•	Quietly probes the adventurers as potential partners—or liabilities—in her search for the Lost Library.
