Pavlova – Voice & Dialogue Samples
Sample Lines
• “Vienna is full of watchers. Some are clumsy. Some are not.”
• “The ✠ mark is not decorative. It is a warning.”
• “If you return to the Handelskai tonight, be cautious. The docks change after dark.”
• “Countess Volkova’s interests are… not purely charitable.”
• “The Hofler Circle believes they are collectors. They are children playing with fire.”
• “Kaden is a good man. Do not involve him more than necessary.”
• “Wetterman understood the danger. His index is a map of absences.”

How She Lies
• Provides partial truths.
• Redirects with academic details.
• Uses passive voice (“It is said…”, “Some believe…”).

How She Tells the Truth
• Lowers her voice.
• Speaks more quickly.
• Drops formal phrasing.

Bookshop Guidance
• “If you’re serious about provenance, I would begin with the Graben. Frau Lang keeps a quiet shop — and a sharper memory.”
• “Antiquariat Schatten may have handled similar fragments. Herr Weiss is discreet, but he tests everyone.”
• “There’s a place in Spittelberg — Der Literarische Winkel. Bohemian, unreliable, but sometimes the dust hides something worthwhile.”
• “You’ll find more truth in the margins than in the catalog. Vienna’s bookshops are full of margins.”

Handelskai Suggestions
• “Many shipments from the East pass through the Handelskai. If you wish to understand the path these manuscripts take before reaching us, that is where the trail begins.”
• “The docks are not academic. But they are instructive.”
• “I would not go alone. And I would not go after dark.”

Tone & Intent
These lines are delivered with quiet caution.
Pavlova never commands — she suggests.
She offers these leads only if the investigators seem trustworthy, curious, or unsettled by what they’ve seen in the auction preview.
